🚀 Selection Sort in C++ - Simple, Powerful, and Perfect for Small Arrays! 🔥
Selection sort is an easy-to-understand sorting algorithm great for learning and working with small datasets. Let's dive into it! 💡

How It Works 🧐
1. Divides the array into sorted and unsorted parts.

2.Repeatedly picks the smallest element from the unsorted part 🥇.

3.Swaps it with the first unsorted element 🔄.

4.Repeats until the entire array is sorted.


✨ Secret Things to Remember ✨
🔍 Comparisons: Makes about n(n-1)/2 comparisons overall, regardless of input.
🔄 Swaps: Only up to n-1 swaps — minimal swaps compared to other simple sorts!
⏱️ Time Complexity: Always O(n^2) — so best for small arrays or educational use.
💾 Space Complexity: In-place; uses no extra memory.
♻️ Stability: Not stable — equal elements may change relative order.
💡 Tip: Good for situations where swaps are expensive but comparisons are cheap.
