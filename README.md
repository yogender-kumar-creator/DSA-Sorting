# 🧹 Bubble Sort Algorithm

Welcome to the Bubble Sort playground! This is a simple yet fundamental sorting algorithm that every programmer should understand deeply to build a strong foundation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). 🚀

## What is Bubble Sort? 🔍

Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order, making the largest/smallest "bubble" to the end of the array on each pass.

- Simple to understand & implement
- Best for small or nearly sorted datasets
- Stable sorting algorithm (preserves order of equal elements) ✅

## How Bubble Sort Works 🔄

1. Compare pairs of adjacent elements
2. Swap if the left element is greater
3. Repeat until no swaps needed (array is sorted!)
4. Each pass places the next largest element at its correct position

## Time Complexity ⏳

| Case        | Time Complexity | Explanation                              |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------------------------------|
| Best Case   | O(n)            | Array already sorted, stops early        |
| Average Case| O(n²)           | Random array, many comparisons & swaps  |
| Worst Case  | O(n²)           | Array sorted in reverse order             |

## Space Complexity 💾

- **O(1)** - In-place algorithm, only uses a temporary variable to swap elements

---

## Why Bubble Sort? Why Not? 🤔

- **Advantages**: Super simple, easy to teach, stable sort  
- **Disadvantages**: Inefficient for large datasets, lots of swaps compared to other sorts
