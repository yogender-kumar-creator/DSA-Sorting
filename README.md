## 📋 What's Inside?

This repo contains implementations of classic sorting algorithms including but not limited to:

- **Bubble Sort** 🟠 — Simple comparison-based sort great for beginners.
- **Selection Sort** 🔍 — Efficient in terms of swaps, intuitive logic.
- **Insertion Sort** ✍️ — Builds a sorted array one item at a time.
- **Merge Sort** 🔀 — Divide and conquer algorithm with \(O(n \log n)\) complexity.
- **Quick Sort** ⚡ — Fast average-case sorting using pivot partitioning.
- **Heap Sort** 🏗️ — Utilizes binary heaps for efficient sorting.
- **Counting Sort** 🧮 — Non-comparison sort ideal for limited ranges.
- **Radix Sort** 🔢 — Sorts numbers digit by digit for linear time complexity.
